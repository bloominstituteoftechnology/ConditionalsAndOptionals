 ## Optionals
 
 >Throughout the exercises in this playground, you will be printing optional values. The Swift compiler will display a warning: "Expression implicitly coerced from `Int?` to Any". For the purposes of these exercises, you can ignore this warning.
 
 Imagine you have an app that asks the user to enter his/her age using the keyboard. When your app allows a user the input text, what is captured for you is given as a `String`. However, you want to store this information as an `Int`. Is it possible for the user to make a mistake and for the input to not match the type you want to store?
 
 Declare a constant `userInputAge` of type `String` and assign it "34e" to simulate a typo while typing age. Then declare a constant `userAge` of type `Int` and use the `Int` initializer and pass in `userInputAge` (`let userAge = Int(userInputAge)`). What error do you get?
 */

let userInputAge: String = "34"
let userAge: Int? = Int(userInputAge)

// The error is:
// error: value of optional type 'Int?' not unwrapped; did you mean to use '!' or '?'?

/*:
 Go back and change the type of `userAge` to `Int?`, and print the value of `userAge`. Why is `userAge`'s value `nil`? Provide your answer in a comment or print statement below.
 */
print(userAge)
// userAge is nil because "34e" can't be converted into an Integer due the 'e' at the end.

/*:
 Now go back and fix the typo on the value of `userInputAge`. Is there anything about the value printed that seems off?
 
 // It prints "Optional(34)" instead of just "34"
 
 Now use optional binding to unwrap `userAge`. If `userAge` has a value, print it to the console.
 */

if let age = userAge {
    print(age)
}
